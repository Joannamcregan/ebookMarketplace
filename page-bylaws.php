The Board may create reasonable reserves for necessary purposes to retain a portion of net proceeds in the Cooperative to help keep operations on a sound financial basis. The retained portion of the patronage refund is allocated to the member’s equity account and paid out at a later date.</li>
                <li>Patronage refunds. All remaining funds shall be distributed and paid to members.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 4. REGULAR REDEMPTION. If at any time the Board of Directors determines that the financial condition of the Cooperative will not be impaired by a redemption, equity credited to members’ accounts may be redeemed in full or in part. Any such redemption of equity shall be made in order of priority according to the year in which the equity was furnished and credited, the equity first received by the Cooperative being the first redeemed.</p>
            <p>SECTION 5. DISCRETIONARY SPECIAL REDEMPTIONS. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws, the Board, at its absolute discretion, shall have the power to retire any equity credited to members’ accounts on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties in any instance in which the interests of the Cooperative and its members are deemed to be furthered thereby and funds are determined by the Board to be available for such purposes.</p>
            <p>SECTION 6. RESERVE FUND. A portion of the Cooperative’s net worth shall be maintained as a Reserve Fund that will serve to protect members and creditors from any operating losses that the Cooperative might incur. The Board of Directors will from time to time determine the proportion of the Cooperative’s surplus or deficit that will be allocated to the Reserve Fund, with the remainder of the surplus or loss to be allocated to individual members. The proportion of patronage allocations to be paid in cash and the proportion to be paid as a non-cash allocation to internal accounts shall be as periodically set by the Board of Directors.</p>
            <p>SECTION 7. CONSENT TO TAKE PATRONAGE DISTRIBUTIONS INTO INCOME. Each person who hereafter applies for and is accepted into membership in this Cooperative and each member of this Cooperative as of the effective date of this bylaw who continues as a member after such date shall, by such act alone, consents that the amount of any distributions with respect to her or his patronage which are made in written notices of allocation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. §1388) and which are received by the member from this Cooperative, will be taken into account by the member at their stated dollar amount in the manner provided in 26 U.S.C. §1385(a) in the taxable year in which the written notices of allocation are received by the member.</p>
            <p>SECTION 8. EQUITY RECORDS. The records of the Cooperative will be kept in such a manner that the patronage refunds and any retained equity (allocated or unallocated) of each member of the Cooperative may be determined at any time. Within eight and one half (8.5) months after the close of the Cooperative’s tax year, each member will receive a “written notice of allocation” which reports each member’s patronage refund and equity retained for the year.</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Equity redemption for terminating members. When a member terminates membership, the equity held within the Cooperative will be refunded, upon written request to the Board, in accordance with Board policy on equity redemption.</li>
                <li>Equity retirement for deceased members. Upon the death of a member, that member’s heirs or legal representative may request, in writing, the retirement of the deceased member’s equity account. The equity account will be redeemed in accordance with Board policy.</li>
                <li>Unclaimed equity. Any equity or Patronage Dividends which remain unclaimed five (5) years after the date authorized for redemption or retirement will be paid or distributed according to Hawai`i statutes in effect at that time for the disposition of unclaimed funds.</li>
                <li>Events of Forfeiture of Patronage. If the Cooperative distributes a Patronage Dividend to a member who (a) does not consent to include the Patronage Dividend in income as provided in Section 7 of this Article; or (b) is unable to receive distribution; or (c) cannot be located for redemption of such Patronage Dividend, such patronage shall revert back to the Cooperative and be applied to the Reserve Fund, as set forth in Section 6 of this Article.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 9. FINANCIAL REVIEW. The Cooperative’s financial accounts will be reviewed and reported on at least once per year by an independent auditor selected by the Board.
